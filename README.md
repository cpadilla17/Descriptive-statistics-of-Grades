# Descriptive-statistics-of-Grades
As a grader of assessments you may want to know the descriptive statistics of the scores received. Descriptive statistics being measures of central tendency and dispersion.

This is my first project as a programmer, showcasing some skills in loops, variables, input/output and module knowledge.
